# Shortest Path

Have the function ShortestPath(strArr) take strArr which will be an array of strings which models a non-looping Graph. The structure of the 
array will be as follows. The first element in the array will be the number of nodes N (points) in the array as string. 

The next N elements will be the nodes which can be anything (A, B, C ..). Then after the Nth element, the rest of the elements in the array will be the connections between all the nodes. Although, there may exist no connections at all.
